"The Amazing World of Butterflies
    
    Butterflies are some of nature's most beautiful creatures. They begin their lives as tiny caterpillars, 
    eating leaves and growing bigger each day. After several weeks, they create a protective shell called 
    a chrysalis around themselves. Inside this shell, they undergo an incredible transformation called 
    metamorphosis. When they emerge, they have colorful wings and can fly from flower to flower, 
    drinking sweet nectar.","metamorphosis:a complete change in form or structure,chrysalis:a protective shell where butterflies develop,nectar:sweet liquid found in flowers,transformation:a complete change in appearance or form",What do caterpillars eat to grow bigger?;What is the protective shell called where butterflies develop?;What do butterflies drink from flowers?,2025-07-12T06:10:21.492452
